# Sales Forecasting with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to forecast future sales based on historical data. Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for optimizing inventory, managing supply chain logistics, and planning marketing strategies. Using machine learning algorithms, this project aims to provide reliable predictions and insights that can help businesses make data-driven decisions to maximize efficiency and profits.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the historical sales data to ensure high-quality input for model training.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Built and trained machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict future sales.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize sales trends and forecast accuracy.
- **Dashboard Integration**: Deployed forecast results in an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring and decision-making.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Date`: Timestamp of sales records (daily/weekly/monthly).
- `Product ID`: Unique identifier for each product.
- `Sales Volume`: Total units sold per period.
- `Revenue`: Revenue generated per period.
- `Region`: Sales region identifier (optional).

### Example Dataset
| Date       | Product ID | Sales Volume | Revenue | Region |
|------------|------------|--------------|---------|--------|
| 2023-01-01 | A123       | 100          | 1000    | North  |
| 2023-01-02 | B456       | 150          | 1500    | East   |

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting-ml.git
   cd sales-forecasting
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Sales_Forecasting.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, feature scaling, and data formatting.
2. **Model Training**: Train the forecasting model using the provided `Sales_Forecasting_Model.ipynb` notebook.
3. **Visualization**: Run the data visualization cells in the notebook to explore trends and interpret the forecast accuracy.
4. **Dashboard Deployment** (optional): Export model predictions to integrate with a dashboard for ongoing monitoring.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For development and model experimentation.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Model building and training (Linear Regression, Random Forest).
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.

## Results
The model was able to predict future sales with a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately **X%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in forecasting with acceptable accuracy.

## Future Improvements
- **Model Enhancement**: Experiment with other algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, LSTM) for better accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate additional features, such as holidays, weather, or promotions, to improve predictions.
- **Real-Time Forecasting**: Deploy the model to forecast sales in real time with new data inputs.
